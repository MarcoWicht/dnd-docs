# Academy of thousand ways

- Most famous magic academy
- Known for training the most powerful and influencing sorcerers/wizards/magic-users the lands have seen in the history of this continent
- neutral party that does not care about alignments(?), and gives everyone a chance to improve their abilities
- only talent matters, students will have to do missions to earn money for the academy, so they dont need to be from wealthy families
- once a year they hold public entrance-exams for new students to enter the academy
- academy accepts missions and requests from all kind of fractions, (monster hunting, artifact retrival, scouting...)

Classes in the academy are usually divided by the schools of magic.
There are several elders/teachers specializing in one or more of these schools.
Some classes are held by long-term students.
The academy focusses more on hands-on experience than theoretic study - propably because there are not enough teachers around...
